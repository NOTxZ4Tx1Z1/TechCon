During creation of my website i used different kind of sources 
of inspiration and solutions for problems im not familiar wiht

1) want to make a reference ot a video i used to create a sortable table for schedule page. 
Table was created by myself, and designed also by myslef, but javascript behind it belongs to author of this channel
link : (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SL_hM1a0yo)

2) want to reference site https://chat.openai.com , i used chat 
gpt for creation of some of the paragraphs, and also to search 
for some of the solutions for problems (usually it was about aligning text, 
or searching for mistakes in my js code)

3) also want to reference another video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE_6pQ3RlZU , 
i used his js code , as this technique is too advanced for me, but i learned something 
new. Obviously design i did myslef. 

4) to create a color scheme i used site (https://coolors.co)
5) to create a gradient i used site (https://cssgradient.io)
6) to create a logo i used site (not gonna lie i forgot its name, but anyways this logo is ai generated)


IMPORTANT:
js code for registration and contact pages i did myself, as i once randomly found a short video 
about usage of regular expresions (when was working through math topic, so i knew about this 
technique long before course work and used in my lab 5 task 3 page))
